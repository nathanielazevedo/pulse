# 🥁 PULSE

**Pulse** is a step-based drum machine and beat pad built with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).  
It’s simple. It’s fast. It’s got that _click-clack_.

I built it because I couldn’t find anything quite like it — and because I wanted a solid excuse to dive into Vue.  
Now it’s my go-to little groove machine in the browser. 🎛️🎚️
